    <p>The Justice League (also known as The Justice League of America) are a team of superheroes 
        appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The team first appeared in The Brave 
        and the Bold #28 (March 1960). The team was conceived by writer Gardner Fox as a revival of the
        Justice Society of America, a similar team from DC Comics from the 1940s which had been pulled 
        out of print due to a decline in sales.
        The Justice League is an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from DC Comics'
        portfolio. Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble
        as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. This in contrast to certain other superhero teams
        such as the X-Men, whose characters were created specifically to be part of the team, with the team 
        being central to their identity. The cast of the Justice League usually features a few highly popular
        characters who have their own solo books, such as Superman and Batman alongside a number of 
        lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure. The Justice League was created to boost the profiles
        and sales of said characters through cross-promotion and helped develop the DC Universe as a shared 
        universe, as it is through teams like the Justice League that the setting's characters regularly 
        interact with each other.</p>
